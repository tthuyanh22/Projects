In the following analysis report, the data set introduced in the article **“The Hat Matrix in Regression and ANOVA” by David C. Hoaglin and Roy E. Welsch (1978)** has been examined. 
This report provides insights into the relationship between the predictor variables *(the constant, specific gravity, and moisture content)*, and the response *(strength)*, thus demonstrates the use of the **hat matrix** in enhancing the robustness and accuracy of regression models.
The primary focus is to explore **the significance of the hat matrix in regression analysis and ANOVA**, highlighting its role in identifying leverage points and assessing the influence of individual observations on the regression model. 
Through this analysis, we aim to illustrate the practical applications of the hat matrix, interpret the coefficients of the regression model, and identify any influential data points that significantly affect the model’s predictions. 
- Upcoming part contains data preprocessing and fitting the linear regression model. 
- In part 3, outlier detection is executed by analysing the Hat matrix.
- Part 4 represents model refitting and outliers’ Influence evaluation.
- In the closing part, key findings and conclusions are highlighted.
